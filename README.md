Presentation of frontend technologies integration

Hi. This is a small presentation of frontend technologies integration.
It represents a small one page web app which provides a matrix multiplication functionality.
Implemented with pure HTML 5, CSS 3 and JavaScript without the use of third party frameworks or libraries (such as Jquery).
